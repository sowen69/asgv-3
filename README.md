#ASG Virtua Website

###Notes:

- Vite is the build system
- React Router is set up for browser routing
- `.htaccess` and `200.html` are to make BrowserRouting work on Apachi servers (probably a better way to do this)
- There are packages I'm not using and havent removed them from package.json
- Using Tailwind (but hate it)
- There are assets in the `/public` folder that may be better as imports from the src
- Tried to comment anything thats not obvious
- All the content is pretty much hard coded. Was hoping to possibly introduce WordPress API as a back end in the future
